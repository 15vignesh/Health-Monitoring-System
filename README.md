# Health-Monitoring-System
The objective of the "Healthcare monitoring system using IoT" project is to develop an IoTbased healthcare monitoring system that enables remote monitoring of patients' vital signs,
such as SPO2, pulse rate, and temperature. The system aims to provide real-time monitoring
and early detection of any abnormality or deviation from the normal range, enabling timely
interventions to improve patient outcomes. The system is designed to be highly scalable,
customizable, and cost-effective, making it an ideal solution for healthcare monitoring in
remote and underserved areas. The integration of Blink database and Arduino microcontroller
adds to the efficiency and reliability of the system
